Inspired by various people/blogs like 
`Eli Bendersky <http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2007/06/19/introducing-the-sicp-reading-notes/>`_,
`SICP Challenge <http://www.billthelizard.com/2009/10/sicp-challenge.html>`_ and
`So you want to do SICP? <http://www.uponmyshoulder.com/blog/2011/so-you-want-to-do-the-sicp/>`_),
I started my own journey of attempting this SICP challenge finally, with the
first blog posted today.

The plan is:

1. Read the whole book
#. Follow the CS 61A course from UCB (the `summer 2012 <http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su12/>`_ version)
#. Practice the example code and do at least 85% of the exercises (with racket and scala)
#. Do at least two of the larger projects listed `here <http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/psets/index.html>`_
#. Finish all the projects of CS 61A
#. Record the process in my blog
